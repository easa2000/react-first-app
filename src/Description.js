        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

        <p>This is a Kentucky Fried Chicken family bucket used in KFC restaurants around 1969. The bucket bears the trademark image of Harland Sanders in his Colonel Sanders outfit—white suit and black string tie—as well as the copyrighted tagline “it's finger lickin' good.” The KFC Chicken 
            bucket was first created in 1957 by Sanders and his first franchisee, Pete Harman. It contained 15 pieces of chicken, a pint of gravy, and biscuits. The idea was sold as a way for housewives to escape the kitchen dinner and still prepare a great dinner, merely needing to add a salad and a vegetable for a balanced meal.</p>
